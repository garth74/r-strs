Description: A package that offers a comprehensive set of string manipulation function based on those
    found in 'Python' without relying on 'reticulate'. It provides functions that intend to (1) make
    it easier for users familiar with 'Python' to work with strings, (2) reduce the complexity often
    associated with string operations, (3) and enable users to write more readable and maintainable
    code that manipulates strings.
