\title{Slice Substrings from a String}
\usage{
strs_slice(string, start = 1L, stop = -1L)
}
\arguments{
\item{string}{A character vector where each element is a string to slice.}

\item{start}{The starting position for slicing (inclusive).}

\item{stop}{The ending position for slicing (exclusive).}
}
\value{
A character vector of the same length as \code{string}, with each element
being the sliced substring.
}
\description{
\code{strs_slice} extracts substrings from each element of a character vector,
specified by start and stop positions. It is similar to Python's slicing
syntax for strings.
}

strs_slice("hello world", 1, 5)
strs_slice("hello world", 7)
strs_slice("hello world", start = 7, stop = 11)
